# Forceteki

Implementation of the Star Wars Unlimited game rules, based on the [Ringteki](https://github.com/ringteki/ringteki) architecture.

We have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/N6ZgcZ3SfA) for updates, bug reports, and coordinating dev work.

### Contributing

For details on how to get started adding cards, see the [wiki](https://github.com/SWU-Karabast/forceteki/wiki).

## Development Quickstart

Follow these instructions to get to the point of being able to run the [unit tests](./test/server/) locally.

#### Required Software

- Git
- Node.js v22.x

### Install Dependencies

The following demonstrates how to install dependencies and also some sample commands for interacting with the repo and running tests.

```bash
# install node dependencies
npm install

# run once to download card definition files
# NOTE: TWI cards are currently being filtered out
npm run get-cards

# run this to transpile (build) the code. the 'npm test' command will automatically run it's own build script.
# rm -r build/  # needed if files are added / deleted / renamed between builds
npm run build

# run this to build and start the server. If you don't have an .env file, it'll create one.
npm run dev

# run code linter (recommend configuring this automatically with Visual Studio Code)
npm run lint
npm run lint-verbose

# runs tsc and executes tests
npm test

# run all tests in parallel for higher speed
# NOTE: there is a known issue with this method, see below
npm run test-parallel

# run a specific test file only
npm test test/server/cards/01_SOR/leaders/LukeSkywalkerFaithfulFriend.spec.js
npm test **/LukeSkywalkerFaithfulFriend.spec.js # use path globbing (may look different depending on your shell)

# re-run a specific test file w/o rebuilding the server folder or copying the card json unless they are missing from the build folder.
npm run test-fast test/server/cards/01_SOR/leaders/LukeSkywalkerFaithfulFriend.spec.js

# run the whole suite in "undo mode": each test runs, rolls back to its start via a snapshot, then runs again
npm run test-undo

# run the whole suite in undo mode in parallel for higher speed
npm run test-parallel-undo
```

**Undo mode**: `npm run test-undo` runs every normal test twice with a snapshot rollback in between to verify that game state undo behaves correctly. The dedicated undo test files under `test/scenarios/undo/` are automatically skipped in this mode since they already run under undo as part of the normal suite.

**Known issue with `test-parallel`**: in some cases when a test fails using `npm run test-parallel`, there will be a json stringify and it will not explain which test failed, only which suite. In this case you must re-run the tests using the standard `npm test` to determine the specifics.

### Linting

We've configured a set of eslint rules to keep the repo looking consistent and help catch potential bugs. These rules are checked at PR time.

To facilitate using them locally, we've set up VSCode integration so the rules will be applied automatically while you work. Just install the [VSCode ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint), open the repo as a folder in vscode, and everything should work automatically.

### VSCode Debugging

We have a preconfigured [launch.json](.vscode\launch.json) file with debug profiles for use in Visual Studio Code. Open the repo as a folder in vscode and the profiles should load automatically under "Run and Debug" tab (ctrl + shift + D). See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging for additional details.

Once you have vscode set up, use the `Debug All Jasmine Tests` profile or open a specific test file and run `Debug Open Jasmine Test` to run tests with breakpoints, debugging, etc.

#### Debugging Tips

- You can use the `debugger;` command in node to create a breakpoint in code that will be respected by the vscode debugger
- VSCode has advanced breakpoint features such as conditional breakpoints that are extremely useful for debugging complex situations, we highly recommend reading the "Advanced breakpoint topics" section of this guide if you haven't used it before: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_advanced-breakpoint-topics
- See our [Debugging Guide](https://github.com/SWU-Karabast/forceteki/wiki/Debugging-Guide) for detailed guides on debugging cards

### Mobile Testing and Custom Environment

For testing on mobile devices connected to your local network:

1. Edit `.env` and add ADDITIONAL_CORS_ORIGINS="http://your-local-ip:3000"
2. Restart the development server for the Back-End
3. Update the Front-End with its instructions to allow mobile local connections
4. Connect to your-local-ip:3000 on the web browser of your mobile device

### FAQ
Q. I ran into this error: Importing card class with repeated id!: <card id>
A. Delete your build folder and try to build again, you might have some old card data.
Q. I ran into this error: Missing required environment variables: <name of environment variable>
A. There are a lot of environment variables that are needed for production, but not for local testing. Define the environment variables in your .env folder with any values you want. The value doesn't matter as long as it exists.
