/**
 * Helper class for cost evaluation which serves as a tracker for "dynamic opportunity costs" which are evaluated only at the end
 * of the cost evaluation process.
 *
 * This is required for situations like Exploit + Starhawk, where we can't know whether it's better to exploit Starhawk itself
 * until after all other discounts have been resolved due to the fact that its exact adjustment value is contingent on them.
 *
 * This class facilitates that by holding a function that calculates the discount value after all other discounts, and also
 * supports adding "alternate" flat discount costs for the Exploit case. These will be evaluated together to determine the
 * lowest possible value that must be paid.
